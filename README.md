# Bootswatcher Silverstripe project

Configurable Silverstripe theme using pre-made Bootswatch themes, which uses the most recent version of Bootstrap

## Setup

`composer create-project elliot-sawyer/bootswatcher`

Silverstripe 4 support will follow the 1.x tags.  When 5 support exists, the major version will be 2.x.  A more robust branching strategy should be expected soon.

## Usage

When running a dev/build, the latest themes will be downloaded from the Bootswatch CDN.  Once downloaded, you can visit /admin/settings and select the Theme using the Themes tab
